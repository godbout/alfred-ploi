# Disturbingly Current Features

this is currently so basic that i should feel ashamed to release that shit but i don't. i'm known in the streets as the guy who builds the bare minimum because he's such a lazy bastard and also because he has something else to do like stomping on rocks or drinking mouthfuls of salty water but also because maybe tomorrow he's not gonna be alive who knows so no rush. anyways, here you go:

* refresh OPcache
* single server

that's it. if you need to handle several servers it's not there yet. and if you need to do anything except refresh OPcache well it's not there yet either. but you can always ask for it here and i'll see what i can do: https://github.com/godbout/alfred-ploi/issues
